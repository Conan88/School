    <p style="line-height: 20px;">This smartphone application was made by computer science students Christoffer Berglund, Ruben Nygård Engelsvoll, Anders Gammelsrød, James Khoi Giang and Bjørn-Inge Thoresen at University in Agder, Norway. </p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">The app was made for a project in DAT219, a 4th semester course specializing in internet services on the .NET platform. The goal with this project was to learn how to create web pages and apps, and learn how to use tools like Visual Studio Code and
        .NET. To design the app we were mainly using the code languages JavaScript, C#, CSS and HTML.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">The app was created after inspiration from IMDb, which is the largest movie database on the internet, owned by Amazon. With millions of users and one of the oldest websites on the internet, IMDb has proven to cover a huge marked. Our app will be positioned
        within the same marked, an entertainment database available through a smartphone app. Our goal is to give users access to all relevant information about movies, music and video games in a simple and intuitive way.</p>
